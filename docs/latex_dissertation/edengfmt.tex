%%   ABOUT
%%
%% This is the user defined formatting file for a Latex2e template which
%% corresponds to the regulations regarding layout of a thesis submitted within
%% the University of Edinburgh school of Engineering. It is not `official', but
%% conforms as best as possible to the regulation as detailed at:
%%
%% http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/science-engineering/current-students/
%% research/submitting-thesis
%%
%% Please feel free to alter the template to your own liking, but note that
%% the template is made available under the GNU GPL and must be similarly
%% licenced should you wish to release your modified template.

%%   CREDITS
%%
%% This template is an amalgamtion of an existing Edinburgh University,
%% Electrical Engineering PhD Thesis class file (jthesis-v1.cls) authored by
%% George S Taylor which was released under the GNU GPL.
%% Code is included from the dmathesis class Written by M. Imran
%% for a thesis according to the university of Durham regulation, which was
%% released without copyright. It also contains ideas (possibly code) from the
%% Princeton thesis class file (PrincetonThesis.cls), authored by Mike Nolta.
%% Mathew Topper, Eoghan Maguire and Bill Edwards forsaw the need to maintain a
%% more recent latex implementation of the thesis regulations and thus, this
%% project was born. It is hoped that the template will be maintained by the
%% Edinburgh Engineering PhD community once released.

%%     Date      Programmer         Description of change
%%     ====      ==========         =====================
%%   18/06/10    Mathew Topper      Made copy of format.tex and renamed.
%%
%%   19/06/10                       Added defaultfont to control the header
%%                                  font using class options. Also reduce
%%                                  the size of the header separation.
%%
%%   21/06/10                       Controlling headers using titlesec rather
%%                                  than fancyhdr to avoid confusion.
%%
%%                                  Added \raggedbottom to stop the bad boxes
%%                                  when the twoside option is set.
%%
%%   24/06/10                       Added another pagestyle 'twomain' which can
%%                                  be used to set different headers (for even
%%                                  pages) if twoside option is set.
%%
%%   25/06/10                       Setting bibsep as rapport3 sets it to zero.
%%
%%                                  Added singlespace option.
%%
%%   08/07/10                       Put some plus minus into bibsep to reduce
%%                                  the number of entries that span pages.
%%
%%   12/10/10                       Added option to change the size of the font
%%                                  for subfigure captions.
%%
%%   17/10/10                       Added hypenation penalties for the main body
%%                                  and the bibliography.
%%
%%   20/10/10                       Added space to the footer.
%%
%%   29/10/10                       Added options for hyperref and defined 
%%                                  \autoref and \Autoref commands. They are in
%%                                  a wrapper to stop error if hyper option is
%%                                  not used.
%%
%%   13/06/12                       Added \myfootskip to allow proper setting of
%%                                  rubber length using the minus command rather
%%                                  than the calc package symbol.
%%
%%   03/05/13                       Changed to xcolor package to use 'black'
%%                                  rather than 'Black', which gives a better
%%                                  color match.

%% IN THIS FILE YOU CAN:
%%
%%   ** SET THE MARGINS
%%   ** SET THE LINE SPACING
%%   ** CONTROL THE HYPHENATION
%%   ** ADD VERTICAL SPACE IN ALIGNED EQUATIONS
%%   ** FORMAT THE TABLE OF CONTENTS AND LISTS
%%   ** FORMAT THE BIBLIOGRAPHY
%%   ** CHANGE FONT SIZE OF SUBFIGURE CAPTIONS
%%   ** HYPERREF SETTINGS
%%   ** FORMAT FANCY HEADERS
%%   ** FIX VBOX ERROR WITH 'twoside' OPTION

%%%% SET THE MARGINS

%% Note, the margins here are University of Edinburgh, School of Engineering
%% regulation. You may wish to borrow a millimetre here or there and change
%% the header, for example, and thus the setting of the margins has been made
%% available here. It's not recommended you change these too much!
%% Note: Margins are controlled by the 'geometry' package.
\geometry{top=20mm, inner=40mm, outer=25mm, bottom=40mm}

%% Control the header height and separation for fancyhdr
\geometry{headheight=15.2pt, headsep=4mm}

%% Set the space between the main text and the start of the footnone
\geometry{footnotesep=5mm}

%% Set the space to the footer. We need to define a new length before applying
%% it in order to use the minus rubber length to aid flexibility.
\newlength\myfootskip
\setlength\myfootskip{20mm minus 1em}

\geometry{footskip=\myfootskip}


%%%% SET THE LINE SPACING.

%% Controlled by `setspace' package.
%% Note: you can define environments for different spacings during the
%% document, ie \begin{singlespace}blah blah\end{singlespace}.
%%
%% Quotes are automatically single spaced via this method.

%% Pick one of these three options for global spacing.

% \singlespacing                       % Single spaced

% \onehalfspacing                        % One and a half spaced

% \doublespacing                       % Double spacing

 \setstretch{1.45}                    % Custom spacing. 1.3 ~ onehalf &
                                       % 1.6 ~ double spaced

%%%% HYPHENATION

%% The university regs say ``hyphenation should be avoided if possible''.
%% Latex looks rubbish with no hypenation but you can discourage it until
%% you start to get lots of bad boxs. Try to set this number as high as
%% possible (0-10000). You can also set a separate value for the
%% bibliography using \bibhyphenpenalty.
\hyphenpenalty=4000
\bibhyphenpenalty=1000

%%%% VERTICAL SPACE IN ALIGNED EQUATIONS

%% Set a global spacing between vertically aligned equaions environments.
%% (To add local space after the break do //[some space ie 12pt])
% \setlength{\jot}{14pt}


%%%% TABLE OF CONTENTS AND LISTS

%% These commands are part of the `tocloft' package.

%% Remove the indent on the list of figures and tables.
\setlength{\cftfigindent}{0pt}
\setlength{\cfttabindent}{0pt}


%% Custom skip before chapters in the TOC. This is useful if, say, the
%% appendicies entry is alone at the foot of the page and you need to 
%% add a little more length.

% \addtolength{\cftbeforechapskip}{2pt}


%% If you don't like capitalised titles in the forematter you can change these
%% here.

% \renewcommand{\listfigurename}{List of figures}
% \renewcommand{\listtablename}{List of tables}

%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY

%% plus, minus reduces the number of entries which span pages.
%\setlength{\bibsep}{2ex plus 1ex minus 1ex}

%% Rename bibliography should you desire
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

%%%% SUBFIGURE CAPTIONS

%% Change size of subfigure captions.
%%\captionsetup[subfloat]{font=normalsize}


%%%% HYPERREF (for hyper package option).

%% Provide options to hyperref. The boolean wrapper
%% makes sure it won't mess up if the hyper option is not used.

%%%% FANCY HEADERS (using titlesec)

%% You can mess around with these if you like, but I wouldn't bother, really.
%% DON'T CHANGE THE NAMES 'main' AND 'twomain'.

%% Headers for the main body of the text, ie from the contents onwards.

%% If there is no chapter number then uppercase lettering is used.
%% Format is {left}{center}{right}. \default sets the font to sans.
